## About <a name="about"></a>
- This project is part of the Interview Preparation Sprint at ALX, where we dive deep into Data Structures and Algorithms. Here, we specifically tackle the UTF8 Validation problem

## Learning Objectives <a name="learning-objectives"></a>
- How to approach algorithm problems in an interview setup

## Requirements <a name="requirements"></a>
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of this project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the pycodestyle (version `2.8.*`)
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`
For the UTF8 Validation project, you will need to apply your knowledge in bitwise operations, understanding of the UTF-8 encoding scheme, and Python programming skills to validate whether a given dataset represents a valid UTF-8 encoding.

### Concepts Needed
#### 1. Bitwise Operations in Python:
- Understanding how to manipulate bits in Python, including operations like AND(`&`), OR(`|`), XOR(`^`), NOT(`~`), shifts(`<<`, `>>`)
#### 2. UTF-8 Encoding Scheme:
- Familiarity with the UTF-8 encoding rules, including how characters are encoded into one or more bytes.
- Understanding the patterns that represent a valid UTF-8 encoded character.
#### 3. Data Representation:
- How to represent and work with data at the byte level.
- Handling the least significant bits (LSB) of integers to simulate byte data.
#### 4. List Manipulation in Python:
- Iterating through lists, accessing list elements, and understanding list comprehensions.
#### 5. Boolean Logic:
- Applying logical operations to make decisions within the program.
By studying these concepts and utilizing the resources provided, you will be equipped to tackle the UTF-8 validation project, effectively applying bitwise operations and logical reasoning to determine the validity of UTF-8 encoded data.
