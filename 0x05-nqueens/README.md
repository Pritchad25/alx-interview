## About <a name="about"></a>
This project is part of the Interview Preparation Sprint at ALX, where we dive deep into Data Structures and Algorithms. Here, we specifically tackle the N Queens problem.

## Learning Objectives <a name="learning-objectives"></a>
How to approach algorithm problems in an interview setup

## Requirements <a name="requirements"></a>
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of this project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the pycodestyle (version `2.8.*`)
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`

The NQueens project is a classic problem in computer science and mathematics, known for its application of the backtracking algorithm to place N non-attacking queens on an NÃ—N chessboard. To successfully complete this project, you will need to understand several key concepts and have access to resources that will help you grasp the necessary algorithms and techniques.
### Concepts Needed
#### 1. Backtracking Algorithms:
- Understanding how backtracking algorithms work to explore all potential solutions to a problem and backtrack when a solution cannot be completed.
#### 2. Recursion:
- Using recursive functions to implement backtracking algorithms.
#### 3. List Manipulations in Python:
- Creating and manipulating lists, especially to store the positions of queens on the board.
#### 4. Python Command Line Arguments:
- Handling command-line arguments with the `sys` module
