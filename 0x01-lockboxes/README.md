## About <a name="about"></a>
This project is part of the Interview Preparation Sprint at ALX, where we dive deep into Data Structures and Algorithms. Here, we specifically tackle the LockBoxes problem.

## Learning Objectives <a name="learning-objectives"></a>
- How to approach algorithm problems in an interviwe setup

## Requirements <a name="requirements"></a>
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of this project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the pycodestyle (version `2.8.*`)
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`
- Your code should be documented
### Must Know
For this project, you will need a solid understanding of several key concepts in order to develop a solution that can efficiently determine if all boxes can be opened. Hereâ€™s a list of concepts and resources that will be instrumental in tackling this project:
#### Concepts Needed:
##### 1. Lists and List Manipulation:
- Understanding how to work with lists, including accessing elements, iterating over lists, and modifying lists dynamically.
##### 2. Graph Theory Basics:
- Although not explicitly required, knowledge of graph theory (especially concepts related to traversal algorithms like Depth-First Search or Breadth-First Search) can be very helpful in solving this problem, as the boxes and keys can be thought of as nodes and edges in a graph.
##### 3. Algorithmic Complexity:
- Understanding the time and space complexity of your solution is important, as it can help in writing more efficient algorithms.
##### 4. Recursion:
- Some solutions might require a recursive approach to traverse through the boxes and keys.
##### 5. Queue and Stack:
- Knowing how to use queues and stacks is crucial if implementing a breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to traverse through the keys and boxes.
##### 6. Set Operations:
- Understanding how to use sets for keeping track of visited boxes and available keys can optimize the search process.

By reviewing these concepts and utilizing these resources, you will be well-equipped to develop an efficient solution for this project, applying both your algorithmic thinking and Python programming skills.
