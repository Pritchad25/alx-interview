## About <a name="about"></a>
This project is part of the Interview Preparation Sprint at ALX, where we dive deep into Data Structures and Algorithms. Here, we specifically tackle the Minimum Operations problem.

## Learning Objectives <a name="learning-objectives"></a>
- How to approach algorithm problems in an interview setup

## Requirements <a name="requirements"></a>
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of this project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the pycodestyle (version `2.8.*`)
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`
- Your code should be documented
For this project, you will need to understand several key algorithmic and mathematical concepts to devise a solution that efficiently calculates the minimum number of operations to achieve a given number of characters using only “Copy All” and “Paste” operations. 
### Concepts Needed:
#### 1. Dynamic Programming:
- Familiarity with dynamic programming can help in breaking down the problem into simpler subproblems and building up the solution.
#### 2. Prime Factorization:
- Understanding how to perform prime factorization is crucial since the problem can be reduced to finding the sum of the prime factors of the target number `n`.
#### 3. Code Optimization:
- Knowing how to approach problems from an optimization perspective can be useful in finding the most efficient solution.
#### 4. Greedy Algorithms:
- The problem can also be approached with greedy algorithms, choosing the best option at each step.
#### 5. Basic Python Programming:
- Proficiency in Python, including loops, conditionals, and functions, is necessary to implement the solution.
By studying these concepts and utilizing the resources provided, you will be equipped to tackle the “Minimum Operations” problem effectively, applying both mathematical reasoning and programming skills to find the most efficient solution.
