## About <a name="about"></a>
This repository contains projects that are part of the Interview Preparation Sprint at ALX, where we dive deep into Data Structures and Algorithms. Here, we specifically tackle the different interview problems and the patterns that are seen amongst common problems.

## Requirements <a name="requirements"></a>
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of this project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the pycodestyle (version `2.8.*`)
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`
