## About <a name="about"></a>
This project is part of the curriculum of the ALX Software Engineering program. The main objective of this project is to understand and implement
Python Dynamic Programming to solve Algorithm problems, in preparation for future interviews.

## Learning Objectives <a name="learning-objectives"></a>
- Sieve of Eratosthenes: An efficient algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to any given limit, which can be particularly useful for
this task.
- Game Theory: Basic principles of competitive games where players take turns and the concept of optimal play.
- Dynamic Programming/Memoization: Using previous results to make future calculations faster, potentially necessary for optimizing the solution for
multiple rounds of the game.

## Requirements <a name="requirements"></a>
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `python3` (version 3.4.3)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the `PEP 8` style (version 1.7.x)
- All your files must be executable
