## About <a name="about"></a>
This project is part of the Interview Preparation Sprint at ALX, where we dive deep into Data Structures and Algorithms. Here, we specifically tackle the Log Parsing program.


## Learning Objectives <a name="learning-objectives"></a>
- How to approach algorithm problems in an interview setup

## Requirements <a name="requirements"></a>
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of this project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the pycodestyle (version `2.8.*`)
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`
For the Log Parsing project, project, you will need to apply your knowledge of Python programming, focusing on parsing and processing data streams in real-time. This project involves reading from standard input (stdin), handling data in a specific format, and performing calculations based on the input data.
### Concepts Needed:
#### 1. File I/O in Python:
- Understand how to read from `sys.stdin` line by line.
#### 2. Signal Handling in Python:
- Handling keyboard interruption (CTRL + C) using signal handling in Python.
#### 3. Data Processing:
- Parsing strings to extract specific data points.
- Aggregating data to compute summaries.
#### 4. Regular Expressions:
- Using regular expressions to validate the format of each line.
#### 5. Dictionaries in Python:
- Using dictionaries to count occurrences of status codes and accumulate file sizes.
#### 6. Exception Handling:
- Handling possible exceptions that may arise during file reading and data processing.
By studying these concepts and utilizing the resources provided, you will be well-prepared to tackle the log parsing project, effectively handling data streams, parsing log entries, and computing metrics based on the processed data.

## Getting Started <a name="getting-started"></a>
